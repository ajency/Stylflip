PHPMYADMIN: you will have to tunnel into the server to access phpmyadmin. If you use a shell program, use the following command : ssh -N -L 8888:127.0.0.1:80 -i /Users/cutoverRooster/Dropbox/styleflip/stylflip-dev.pem bitnami@54.149.49.29

I have attached both the ppk (for filezilla) and pem (for ssh) here.

Call me tomorrow and I'll explain how to access this.

ssh - tunnels - port - 8888 
		destination - localhost:80
